  # BLFS
  ### Bitcoin Lightning For Shopify
</div>

## About

BLFS (Bitcoin Lightning for Shopify) is a lightweight server application. It connects Shopify merchants to Bitcoin Lightning payments via NWC (Nostr Wallet Connect). 

**Decentralization:** BLFS is designed to be run by anyone. Any developer may run their own BLFS instance and connect merchants to any of many NWC-compatible Lightning services. 

### How BLFS Works: Two Key Roles

#### Role #1: Shopify Merchant üõçÔ∏è
The store owner who wants to accept Bitcoin Lightning payments.

#### Role #2: BLFS Developer üë®‚Äçüíª
A developer who sets up and operates BLFS to integrate Lightning payments with Shopify store(s).

### Basic Setup: One Developer, One Merchant (Merchant connects to an NWC service)

```mermaid
graph LR
  Dev["üë®‚Äçüíª BLFS Developer"] --> Merch["üõçÔ∏è Shopify Merchant"]
  Merch --> NWC["‚ö° NWC Service (e.g., Rizful, Alby Hub, LNbits, Coinos, Wallet of Satoshi)"]
  
  style Dev fill:#e65100
  style Merch fill:#2196f3
  style NWC fill:#9c27b0
```

### Scalable Setup: One Developer, Multiple Merchants (each merchant picks their own NWC)

A single BLFS developer can service multiple Shopify merchants, managing Lightning payment infrastructure for all of them.

```mermaid

  style NWC1 fill:#9c27b0
  style NWC2 fill:#9c27b0
  style NWC3 fill:#9c27b0
  style NWC4 fill:#9c27b0
```



### Complete Ecosystem: Maximum Decentralization (many devs, many merchants, many NWC services; always Merchant ‚Üí NWC)

Each merchant can choose any NWC service, and each developer can support multiple merchants. This creates a truly permissionless, censorship-resistant payment infrastructure.

```

**Key Benefits:**
- üîÄ **No vendor lock-in** - Merchants can switch NWC providers anytime
- üõ°Ô∏è **Censorship resistant** - No single point of control or failure
- üåê **Geographic diversity** - Developers and services can be anywhere
- üí™ **Resilient** - If one service or developer goes down, others continue operating

**How it works with NWC:** BLFS uses Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) to communicate with Lightning nodes, wallets, and vaults. Merchants provide a receive-only NWC connection string, and BLFS runs a lightweight web server that handles invoice generation, payment monitoring, and marking orders as "paid" in Shopify's database. 

**Incentives:** Developers (subject to agreement with Shopify merchants) may earn fees on each Shopify sale through BLFS. One developer can service multiple merchants. This is an excellent tool for an independent operator who wants to onboard a number of Shopify merchants.

## Acknowledgments 

This implementation is inspired by the BTCPay Server Shopify plugin created by [TChukwuleta](https://github.com/TChukwuleta), [ndeet](https://github.com/ndeet), and [NicolasDorier](https://github.com/NicolasDorier).

Our goal was to build something similar, but that did not require a running `bitcoind`, `btcpayserver`, `nbitcoin`, and that required Lightning payments by default, so as to give consumers and merchants a "payment completed in 2 seconds" guarantee. (As long as a high-performance NWC service is used!)

## Technical Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Linux VPS (minimum 1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Domain name pointed to your VPS
- Shopify Partner account (FREE)

### Environment Configuration

1. **Copy the example environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` file and set these 3 required variables:**

   - **`THIS_APP_DOMAIN`** - Your hostname/domain for BLFS (e.g., `pay.yourdomain.com`)
     ```bash
     THIS_APP_DOMAIN=pay.yourdomain.com
     ```

   - **`MASTER_KEY`** - A 32-byte hex string for encrypting sensitive data. Generate with:
     ```bash
     openssl rand -hex 32
     ```
     Then paste the output:
     ```bash
     MASTER_KEY=your_generated_hex_string_here
     ```

   - **`DEVELOPER_PASSWORD`** - Password for accessing the `/dev` portal
     ```bash
     DEVELOPER_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
     ```

   All other variables in `.env.example` have sensible defaults and don't need to be changed.

### Installation & Startup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MegalithicBTC/BLFS
   cd BLFS
   ```

2. **Configure environment** (see above)

3. **Start BLFS:**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Build and start the Docker containers (app + Caddy)
   - Initialize the SQLite database
   - Issue a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for your domain
   - Start the application on the configured port

4. **Access the Developer Portal:**
   
   Navigate to `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/dev` (e.g., `https://pay.yourdomain.com/dev`)
   
   Log in with your `DEVELOPER_BASIC_USER` and `DEVELOPER_PASSWORD` credentials.
   
   From here you can:
   - Add merchant shops
   - Configure NWC connections
   - Deploy to Shopify stores
   - Monitor transactions

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Start BLFS
./start.sh

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Stop BLFS
docker-compose down

```

### Architecture

- **Node.js/Express** - Application server
- **TypeORM + SQLite** - Database layer
- **Caddy** - Reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS
- **Docker Compose** - Container orchestration
- **Nostr Wallet Connect** - Lightning payment protocol

### Optional: Litestream Database Replication

BLFS includes optional [Litestream](https://litestream.io/) support for continuous SQLite replication to cloud storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or local filesystem). This provides disaster recovery and enables zero-downtime migrations.

To enable Litestream backups, configure the following in your `.env` file:

```bash
LITESTREAM_REPLICA_URL=s3://your-bucket/replication/app.sqlite
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

See the [Litestream documentation](https://litestream.io/guides/s3/) for detailed configuration options.
